      <h2>Welcome!</h2>
<h3>Below, please find a few samples of my work as well as a brief intro about what I enjoy doing.
  
    </h3>
      <p>I have been creating original, multimedia content for 19 years. It all started when my parents gave me my first camera, the kind that uses flash cubes lol. Since that time, I've had the pleasure of photographing many weddings and serving in our Armed Forces as a Combat Photographer. Currently, I work for Mayo Clinic's College of Medicine and Science where I produce video content to market Mayo's academic programs.
